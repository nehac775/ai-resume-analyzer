Resume Builder (my version)

Why I built it:
---------------
I was tired of messing around with Word/Google Docs for resumes,
so I thought it'd be cool to just enter data and get a PDF out.
Also gave me an excuse to practice Streamlit + PDF generation.

Notes & Struggles:
------------------
- My first try used `cell` instead of `multi_cell` â†’ text was overflowing off the page.
- I forgot to add page breaks and the PDF looked broken.
- Spacing/alignment was a nightmare at first; fixed by using consistent fonts/sizes.
- TODO: Add multiple template designs (modern vs simple).
- TODO: Add job description keyword highlighting (to match ATS systems).
